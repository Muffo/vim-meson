### How to update vim-meson

cd to a git checkout of vim-meson. Then run the 'pull-upstream' script. That's
all.

Example:

    If you've checked out this meta branch, then there's no need for a separate
    checkout for the master branch. The 'pull-upstream' script doesn't care
    either way.


    $ git checkout meta
    $ ls
    README
    pull-upstream
    ...
    $ ./pull-upstream
    $ git show --oneline
